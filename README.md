This project sets up a local development environment for Odoo 16 on a Windows machine using Python and PostgreSQL. The setup includes a virtual environment for Python dependencies, a PostgreSQL database with a dedicated user (odoo_user), and a custom configuration for managing Odoo behavior through an odoo.conf file. The goal is to provide a complete and modular workspace suitable for developing or testing custom modules — in this case, one named civictrack.

To begin, the Odoo 16 source code must be downloaded or cloned into a directory, such as C:\Users\YourName\odoo. Inside this directory, a Python virtual environment is created using python -m venv venv, which isolates Odoo dependencies from the system-wide Python installation. After activating the environment using PowerShell (.\venv\Scripts\activate), required packages listed in requirements.txt are installed with pip. Additionally, key packages like psycopg2-binary (for PostgreSQL connection) and pyopenssl (for SSL-related features) must be installed manually if not already included.

A PostgreSQL server must be installed and running locally. Within PostgreSQL, a user odoo_user with the ability to create databases should be created, and a dedicated database named civictrack should be assigned to this user. This database will store all the data for the Odoo instance. These steps can be done either via pgAdmin or using psql in the terminal with SQL commands like CREATE USER, ALTER ROLE, and CREATE DATABASE.

An important configuration file, odoo.conf, tells Odoo how to connect to the database and where to find modules. This file must contain parameters such as db_host, db_port, db_user, db_password, and paths to both standard and custom addons. You may also set logging options and enable developer mode. A typical odoo.conf includes the line addons_path = addons,custom_addons, allowing Odoo to detect both default and user-defined modules like civictrack.

To start the server and initialize the database, a command such as python odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -d civictrack -i base --log-level=debug --dev=all should be executed from within the activated virtual environment. This command loads the core modules and outputs detailed logs to the terminal or a designated log file, helping you monitor server activity and debug issues. Once the server starts, you can access the Odoo web interface by visiting http://localhost:8069 in your browser. If the database hasn't been set up yet, Odoo will show the database manager page where you can create or select a database.

In case of errors such as 500 Internal Server Error or connection issues, it's crucial to check the odoo.log file for detailed tracebacks. Common problems include incorrect database credentials, missing Python packages, or misconfigured settings in odoo.conf. Using --log-level=debug helps uncover these issues during development. It’s also important to ensure that PowerShell script execution policies do not block activation of the virtual environment. If that happens, you can temporarily bypass it using Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.

Ultimately, this setup provides a clean, modular, and reproducible Odoo development environment. It is well-suited for both learning and contributing to custom Odoo modules while ensuring that system-wide dependencies remain untouched. With careful setup and correct configuration, you can build and test features within the civictrack module or any other module under custom_addons, leveraging Odoo’s full extensibility and powerful ORM features.
